h1. Heimdallr

A set of modular account management tools

h2. Dependencies

This contains custom elements from polymer and eleminty. Both of these are in the ucla/eleminty repo, which is included as submodule of heimdallr.

If a new version of eleminty comes out, you can update it by running @git submodule update --remote@ from within this project dir. The web components used in Heimdallr will automatically import those updated components. :)
